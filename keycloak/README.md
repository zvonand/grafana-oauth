## Demo setup for Grafana <-> Keycloak <-> ClickHouse OAuth integration

This setup runs Grafana, ClickHouse and Keycloak in Docker (locally). Keycloak is used as an external authenticator and external user directory by both Grafana and ClickHouse.

In this set-up, everything is already pre-configured and dockerized.

in Keycloak, a user with name `demo` is created. This user belongs to group `grafana-admins`, which is translated to Admin group in Grafana itself. Also, this role will be passed down to ClickHouse.

### How to run

0. Clone this repository and navigate to `keycloak` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zvonand/grafana-oauth.git
cd keycloak
```

2. Start Docker containers
```bash
docker compose up
```

3. Wait for this message in Compose logs:
```
grafana-1     | âœ” Downloaded and extracted vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource v3.3.0 zip successfully to /var/lib/grafana/plugins/vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource
```

4. In your web browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Click "Sign in with Keycloak" on the login page:

6. If prompted, use `demo` as both username and password.

7. Go to "Connections" -> "Data Sources" tab (in the left vertical menu), press "add data source" and search for **Altinity plugin for ClickHouse** ![Screenshot from 2024-12-16 15-41-05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe2ce8d1-ea4a-488b-9cc7-c44c270de5b0)

3. Enter the query: `select currentUser()`, and press "Run Query", the username shall be printed. The username is the same as `sub` value in your Azure AD. 

By default, ClickHouse does not grant any roles or privileges to external users. All the user can do is basically view his own name. That is why a role `general-role` and `can-read` roles is created on start-up.

* ClickHouse is configured to assign role `general-role` to __all__ users defined in Keycloak. This role allows to read `can_read_general` table in `default` database. This table is pre-defined and has one row.
* Also, in Keycloak your user belongs to a group `can-read`. This group is mapped to the corresponding role in ClickHouse, and this role allows user to read `default.can_read_specific` table. This table is also pre-defined and has one row.

You can verify that user is actually able to read the tables:

4. Enter the query: `select * from default.can_read_specific` or `select * from default.can_read_general`, and press "Run Query". No exceptions shall be thrown, and table contents will be printed.
